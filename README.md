# Maven-Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
**Project Brief**:

This is a guided project that I worked on,where I assumed the role of a **Sales/Perfomance Analyst** in **Maven Roasters**-a chain of coffee stores accross its three branhes.
The sole task of this project was to transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that the franchise owner of Maven Roasters can use to identify patterns,trends and opportunities in the business.

**Project Introduction**:

The data comprises of sales transactions recorded accross the three Maven Roatser coffee branches from January 2023 to June 2023.
To prepare the data for analysis ,few operations were exectued : adding new columns:Revenue,Monnth(Month Name and Month ID),Week no.~for tracking by week,Day attributes(Name of Day of week and index of Day of Week) and Hour the transaction was carried out.These have been highlighted in yellow in the Excel sheet.The above informtion as extracted from the 'transaction_date' atttribute.
Onto a diiferent sheet,I further discovered the data through coming up with various Pivot Tables to aid in meeting the onwer's expectation from this data.
Among the Pivots were: Revenue by Month,No.of Transactions per product type,No.of Transactions per Product Type,No.of Transactions per Hour of Day and Top 15 product types by No.of Transactions.

**Insghts from The Data**:

In an overview summary,Coffee Sales has been increasing from January,despite a litle dip in Feb.Sales from Coffee product type contributes a significant stake to sales made by no.of transactions while Packaged Chocolate was least bought across the three branches.
Additionaly, 'sales time' re morning hours from 6:00 a.m to about 10:00 a.m where it reduces to a level of no change in sales from 11:00 a.m upto 6:00 p.m that expreince fewer sales upto closure time(8:00 a.m)
